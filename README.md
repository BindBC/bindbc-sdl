# BindBC-SDL
This project provides a set of both static and dynamic bindings to
[SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://libsdl.org/) and its official extension libraries. They are compatible with `@nogc` and `nothrow` and can be compiled with `-betterC` compatibility. This package is intended as a replacement of [DerelictSDL2](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2), which does not provide the same level of compatibility.

## License

BindBC-SDL&mdash;as well as every other binding in the [BindBC project](https://github.com/BindBC)&mdash;is licensed under the [Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).

Bear in mind that you still need to abide by [SDL's license](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), and the licenses of any SDL_* libraries that you use through these bindings.

## SDL Documentation
This readme describes how to use BindBC-SDL, *not* SDL. BindBC-SDL is a direct D binding to the SDL API, so any existing SDL documentation and tutorials can be adapted with only minor modifications.
* [The SDL Wiki](https://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage) has official documentation of the SDL API.
* [The SDL 2 tutorials from Lazy Foo' Productions](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) are a good start for those unfamiliar with the API.

> __Note__
>
> The bindings for `SDL_atomics.h` have not been thoroughly tested. If the `SDL_atomics` binding causes trouble and you don't need to use it, you can supply the version identifier `SDL_No_Atomics` and the module's contents will not be compiled. If it's causing trouble and you need it, please report an issue.

## Quickstart guide
To use BindBC-SDL in your dub project, add it to the list of `dependencies` in your dub configuration file. The easiest way is by running `dub add bindbc-sdl` in your project folder. The result should look like this:

Example __dub.json__
```json
"dependencies": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "~>1.3.0",
},
```
Example __dub.sdl__
```sdl
dependency "bindbc-sdl" version="~>1.3.0"
```

By default, BindBC-SDL is configured to compile as a dynamic binding that is not BetterC-compatible. If you prefer static bindings or need BetterC compatibility, they can be enabled via `subConfigurations`. For configuration naming, see [Configurations](#configurations).

Example __dub.json__
```json
"subConfigurations": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "staticBC",
},
```
Example __dub.sdl__
```sdl
subConfiguration "bindbc-sdl" "staticBC"
```

If you need to use the SDL_* libraries, or versions of SDL newer than 2.0.0, then you will have to add the appropriate version identifiers to `versions` in your dub configuration. For a list of library version identifiers, see [Library versions](#library-versions).

If using static bindings, then you will also need to add the name of each library you're using to `libs`.

Example __dub.json__
```json
"versions": [
	"SDL_2014", "SDL_Net_200"
],
"libs": [
	"SDL2", "SDL2_net"
],
```
Example __dub.sdl__
```sdl
versions "SDL_2014" "SDL_Net_200"
libs "SDL2" "SDL2_net"
```

**If you're using static bindings**: `import bindbc.sdl` in your code, and then you can use SDL just like you would in C. That's it!
```d
import bindbc.sdl;

void main(){
	SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
	
	//etc.
	
	SDL_Quit();
}
```

**If you're using dynamic bindings**: you need to load each library you need with the appropriate load function. 

For most use cases, it's best to use BindBC-Loader's [error handling API](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-loader#error-handling) to see if there were any failures while loading the libraries. This information can be written to a log file before aborting the program.

The load function will also return a member of the `SDLSupport` enum (or equivalent: e.g. `SDLNetSupport` for SDL_net) which can be used for debugging:

* `noLibrary` means the library failed to load. Usually this is because it couldn't be found.
* `badLibrary` means one or more symbols in the library failed to load.
* A version number. This version *should* match the library version you entered in your dub configuration. You can make sure it does match by comparing it with `sdlSupport` (or equivalent: e.g. `sdlNetSupport` for SDL_net). If it doesn't match then you may have the wrong library version installed on your computer, or even multiple versions installed at once!

Here's a simple example using only 

```d
import bindbc.sdl;

/*
This version attempts to load the SDL shared library using
well-known variations of the library name for the host system.
*/
SDLSupport ret = loadSDL();
if(ret != sdlSupport){
	/*
	Error handling. For most use cases, it's best to use the error handling API in
	BindBC-Loader to retrieve error messages for logging and then abort.
	If necessary, it's possible to determine the root cause via the return value:
	*/
	if(ret == SDLSupport.noLibrary){
		//The SDL shared library failed to load
	}else if(SDLSupport.badLibrary){
		/*
		One or more symbols failed to load. The likely cause is that the shared library is for a lower version than BindBC-SDL was configured to load (via SDL_204, SDL_2010 etc.)
		*/
	}
}

/*
This version attempts to load the SDL library using a user-supplied file name. Usually, the name and/or path used
will be platform specific, as in this example which attempts to load `sdl2.dll` from the `libs` subdirectory,
relative to the executable, only on Windows.
*/
version(Windows) loadSDL("libs/sdl2.dll");
```

[The error handling API](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-loader#error-handling) in BindBC-Loader can be used to log error messages:
```d
import bindbc.sdl;

/*
Import the sharedlib module for error handling. Assigning an alias ensures the function names do not conflict with
other public APIs. This isn't strictly necessary, but the API names are common enough that they could appear in other
packages.
*/
import loader = bindbc.loader.sharedlib;

bool loadLib(){
	/*
	Compare the return value of loadSDL with the global `sdlSupport` constant to determine if the version of SDL
	configured at compile time is the version that was loaded.
	*/
	auto ret = loadSDL();
	if(ret != sdlSupport){
		//Log the error info
		foreach(info; loader.errors){
			/*
			A hypothetical logging function. Note that `info.error` and `info.message` are `const(char)*`, not
			`string`.
			*/
			logError(info.error, info.message);
		}
		
		//Optionally construct a user-friendly error message for the user
		string msg;
		if(ret == SDLSupport.noLibrary){
			msg = "This application requires the SDL library.";
		}else{
			msg = "The version of the SDL library on your system is too low. Please upgrade."
		}
		//A hypothetical message box function
		showMessageBox(msg);
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```

## Configurations
BindBC-SDL has the following configurations:

|      â”Œ      |  DRuntime  |   BetterC   |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Dynamic** | `dynamic`  | `dynamicBC` |
| **Static**  | `static`   | `staticBC`  |

For projects that don't use dub, if BindBC-SDL is compiled for static bindings then the the version identifier `BindSDL_Static` must be passed to your compiler/linker.

> __Note__
>
> The version identifier `BindBC_Static` can be used to configure all of the _official_ BindBC packages used in your program. (i.e. those maintained in [the BindBC GitHub organization](https://github.com/BindBC)) Some third-party BindBC packages may support it as well.

The dynamic bindings have no link-time dependency on the SDL libraries, so the SDL shared libraries must be manually loaded at runtime.
At runtime, the SDL shared libraries are required to be on the shared library search path of the user's system.
On Windows, this is typically handled by distributing the SDL DLLs with your program.
On other systems, it usually means installing the SDL runtime libraries through a package manager.

The static bindings have a link-time dependency on the SDL libraries&mdash;either the static libraries or the appropriate files for linking with shared libraries on your system.

By default, each BindBC-SDL binding is configured to compile bindings for the lowest supported version of the C libraries. This ensures the widest level of compatibility at runtime. This behavior can be overridden via specific version identifiers. It is recommended that you always select the minimum version you require _and no higher_. In this example, the SDL dynamic binding is compiled to support SDL 2.0.4:

__dub.json__
```json
"dependencies": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "~>1.3.0",
},
"versions": [
	"SDL_204",
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```sdl
dependency "bindbc-sdl" version="~>1.3.0"
versions "SDL_204"
```

With this example configuration, `sdlSupport` is configured at compile time as `SDLSupport.sdl204`. If SDL 2.0.4 or later is installed on the system, `loadSDL` will return `SDLSupport.sdl204`. If a lower version of SDL is installed, `loadSDL` will return `SDLSupport.badLibrary`. In this scenario, calling `SDL_GetVersion()` will return an `SDLSupport` member indicating which version of SDL, if any, actually loaded.

If a lower version is loaded, it's still possible to call functions from that version of SDL, but any calls to functions from versions between that version and the one you configured will result in a null pointer access. For example, if you configured `SDL 2.0.4` and loaded `SDL 2.0.2`, then function pointers from both 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 will be `null`. For this reason, it's recommended to always specify your required version of the SDL library at compile time and abort when you receive an `SDLSupport.badLibrary` return value from `loadSDL`.

No matter which version was configured, the successfully loaded version can be obtained via a call to `loadedSDLVersion`. It returns one of the following:

* `SDLSupport.noLibrary` if `loadSDL` returned `SDLSupport.noLibrary`
* `SDLSupport.badLibrary` if `loadSDL` returned `SDLSupport.badLibrary` and no version of SDL successfully loaded
* a member of `SDLSupport` indicating the version of SDL that successfully loaded. When `loadSDL` returns `SDLSupport.badLibrary`, this will be a version number lower than the one configured at compile time. Otherwise, it will be the same as the manifest constant `sdlSupport`.

The function `isSDLLoaded` returns `true` if any version of the shared library has been loaded and `false` if not.

```d
SDLSupport ret = loadSDL();
if(ret != sdlSupport) {
	if(SDLSupport.badLibrary) {
		/*
		Let's say we've configured support for SDL 2.0.10 for some of the functions added to the SDL renderer API in
		that version and don't use them if they aren't available. Let's further say that the absolute minimum version
		of SDL we require is 2.0.4, because we rely on some of the functions that version added to the SDL API.

		In this scenario, `SDLSupport.badLibrary` indicates that we have loaded a version of SDL that is less than
		2.0.10. Maybe it's 2.0.9, or 2.0.2. We require at least 2.0.4, so we can check.
		*/
		if(loadedSDLVersion < SDLSupport.sdl204) {
			// Version too low. Handle the error.
		}
	}
	/*
	The only other possible return value is `SDLSupport.noLibrary`, indicating the SDL library or one of its
	dependencies could not be found.
	*/
	else {
		// No library. Handle the error.
	}
}
```

The satellite libraries provide similar functions, e.g., `loadedSDLImageVersion` and `isSDLImageLoaded`.

## Library Versions
These are the supported versions of each SDL_* library, along with the corresponding version identifiers to add to your dub configuration or pass to the compiler.

> __Note__
>
> It is necessary to specify only a single version identifier per library. For example, `SDL_Image_204` by itself will activate the SDL_image binding.
>
> Previously, there were identifiers for the SDL_* libraries with no version. (`SDL_Image`, `SDL_TTF`, etc.) These are are now deprecated due to their ambiguity and older projects are encouraged to remove them.

> __Warning__
>
> SDL 2.0.1 on Windows had a bug preventing `SDL_GetPrefPath` from creating a folder when it doesn't exist. It's fine to compile with `SDL_201`, but make sure to ship your app with 2.0.2 or later on Windows and _verify_ that the [linked version](https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryVersion) is 2.0.2 or later with `SDL_GetVersion`. Alternatively, compile with `SDL_202` on Windows but `SDL_201` on other platforms, thereby guaranteeing an error on Windows if the user doesn't have SDL 2.0.2 or higher.

## Special platforms
Some platforms do not have [pre-defined versions in D](https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#predefined-versions), meaning that BindBC-SDL has to use custom version identifiers for them.
If you intend to compile for any of these platforms, please add the corresponding version identifier(s) in your dub `versions`, or supply them in `-version` to your compiler.

> __Note__
>
> If you're building on Wayland and you have X11 support disabled in SDL, please add version `SDL_NoX11`.

| Version identifier    | Platform                       |

## The static bindings
First things first: static _bindings_ do not require static _linking_. The static bindings have a link-time dependency on either the shared _or_ static SDL libraries and any satellite SDL libraries the program uses. On Windows, you can link with the static libraries or, to use the DLLs, the import libraries. On other systems, you can link with either the static libraries or directly with the shared libraries.

Static bindings require1 the SDL development packages be installed on your system. The [SDL download page](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) provides development packages for Windows and Mac OS X. On other systems, you can install them via your system package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, `apt install sdl2`, or `apt-get install sdl2`, will install both the development and runtime packages.

When linking with the shared (or import) libraries, there is a runtime dependency on the shared library just as there is when using the dynamic bindings. The difference is that the shared libraries are no longer loaded manually&mdash;loading is handled automatically by the system when the program is launched. Attempting to call `loadSDL` with the static binding enabled will result in a compilation error.

When linking with the static libraries, there is no runtime dependency on SDL. The SDL homepage does not distribute pre-compiled static libraries. If you decide to obtain static libraries from another source, or by compiling them yourself, you will also need to ensure that you link with all of SDL's link-time dependencies (such as the OpenGL library and system API libraries).

Personally, I recommend you avoid using any static SDL libraries. Using the static bindings is pefectly fine; just link with the shared libraries.

Enabling the static bindings can be done in two ways.

### Via the compiler's `-version` switch or DUB's `versions` directive
Pass the `BindSDL_Static` version to the compiler and link with the appropriate libraries. Note that `BindSDL_Static` will also enable the static bindings for any satellite libraries used.

When using the compiler command line or a build system that doesn't support DUB, this is the only option. The `-version=BindSDL_Static` option should be passed to the compiler when building your program. All of the required C libraries, as well as the BindBC-SDL static libraries, must also be passed to the compiler on the command line or via your build system's configuration.



For example, when using the static bindings for SDL and SDL_image with DUB:

__dub.json__
```json
"dependencies": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "~>1.3.0"
},
"versions": [
	"BindSDL_Static",
	"SDL_Image",
],
"libs": [
	"SDL2", "SDL2_image",
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```sdl
dependency "bindbc-sdl" version="~>1.3.0"

versions "BindSDL_Static" "SDL_Image"
libs "SDL2" "SDL2_image"
```

### Via DUB subconfigurations
Instead of using DUB's `versions` directive, a `subConfiguration` can be used. Enable the `static` subconfiguration for the BindBC-SDL dependency:

__dub.json__
```json
"dependencies": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "~>1.3.0",
},
"subConfigurations": {
	"bindbc-sdl": "static",
},
"versions": [
	"SDL_Image",
],
"libs": [
	"SDL2",
	"SDL2_image",
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```sdl
dependency "bindbc-sdl" version="~>1.3.0"
subConfiguration "bindbc-sdl" "static"

versions "SDL_Image"
libs "SDL2" "SDL2_image"
```

This has the benefit of completely excluding from the build any source modules related to the dynamic bindings, i.e., they will never be passed to the compiler. Using the version approach, the related modules are still passed to the compiler, but their contents are versioned out.

## `-betterC` support
When not using dub to manage your project, first use dub to compile the BindBC libraries with the `dynamicBC` or `staticBC` configuration, then pass `-betterC` (or equivalent) to the compiler when building your project (and `-version=BindSDL_Static` if you used the `staticBC` configuration).

## Windows: Loading from outside the DLL search path
The SDL libraries load some dependency DLLs dynamically in the same way that BindBC can load libraries dynamically. There is an issue that can arise on Windows when putting some of the SDL DLLs in a subdirectory of your executable directory. That is, if your executable is (for example) in the directory `myapp`, and the SDL DLLs are in the directory `myapp\libs`, you may find that one or more of the SDL libraries fails to load. To solve or prevent this problem, take the following steps:

First, make sure the non-system libraries on which the SDL libraries depend (such as `zlib.dll`) are in the same directory as the SDL libraries.

Second, you'll want to add your subdirectory path to the Windows DLL search path. This can be accomplished via the function `setCustomLoaderSearchPath` in BindBC-Loader`. For more details, see ["Default Windows search path"](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-loader#default-windows-search-path) from the BindBC-Loader readme.

The idea is that you call the function with the path to all of the DLLs before calling any of the load functions, then call it again with a `null` argument to reset to the default search path. Bear in mind that some of the SDL_* libraries load their dependencies lazily. For example, SDL_image will only load `libpng` when `IMG_Init` is called with the `IMG_INIT_PNG` flag, so the second call should not occur until after the libraries have been initialized.

```d
import bindbc.loader,
	bindbc.sdl;

// Assume the DLLs are stored in the "dlls" subdirectory
version(Windows) setCustomLoaderSearchPath("dlls");

if(loadSDL() < sdlSupport) { /* handle error */ }
if(loadSDLImage() < sdlImageSupport) { /* handle error */ }

// Give SDL_image a chance to load libpng and libjpeg
auto flags = IMG_INIT_PNG | IMG_INIT_JPEG;
if(IMG_Init(flags) != flags) { /* handle error */ }

// Now reset the default loader search path
version(Windows) setCustomLoaderSearchPath(null);
```

It is not strictly necessary to reset the default search path, but doing so can avoid unexpected issues for any other dependencies that may be loaded dynamically by an application's process.

`setCustomLoaderSearchPath` is only implemented on Windows. I know of no way to programmatically manipulate the default search path on Linux or other platforms (please correct me if I'm wrong). Then again, this issue doesn't generally arise on those platforms.
